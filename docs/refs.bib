  abstract = {In this paper, presented is a study for predicting the flow stress during hot deformation of carbon steel where the strain rate reaches as high as 3000 s\`A1 at high temperature (700\textendash 1100 8C). We have analyzed thoroughly Shida's constitutive equation generally being used within the strain rate limit of 100 s\`A1 at elevated temperature. It was then assumed possible to obtain the constitutive equation which can depict the flow stress behavior of material beyond strain rate of 100 s\`A1 by modifying the Shida's constitutive equation.},
